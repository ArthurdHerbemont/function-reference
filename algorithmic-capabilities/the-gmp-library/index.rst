The GMP Library
---------------

Through the GMP library you have direct access to mathematical program
instances generated by AIMMS, allowing you to implement advanced
algorithms in an efficient manner. The GMP routines can also be used for
nonlinear models, unless specified otherwise. All procedures and
functions in the GMP library are part of the ``GMP`` namespace in AIMMS.
This namespace is subdivided into the following functional namespaces:
